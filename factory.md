### Why factory design pattern?
* No tightly coupling client code to any other specific concrete classes
* Which class will be instantiated is generally decided in runtime
* Run time polymorphism
* Instead of directly instantiating objects using the ```new``` keyword, the Factory Pattern delegates the responsibility of object creation to a separate entityâ€”a factory.

### When should we use Factory Design Pattern?
* The exact type of object to be created is determined at runtime.
* We want to encapsulate object creation logic to improve code flexibility.
* We need to create objects that belong to a family of related classes.

### Types
1. Simple Factory (Not really a design pattern. More of a programming paradigm)
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
